# Computational_Physics_Fortran
Some Computational Physics Projects done for my 2018 computational physics course in grad school. Simulations coded in Fortran90 (as mandated by Professor) and simulated on UCF's PuTTy. Papers themselves written in LaTeX. Plots made using WolframCloud, Mathematica, MatLab, and Excel 

### Written Reports
